In the Hindu epic Mahabharata,Yudhishthira was the eldest son of King Pandu and Queen Kunti and the king of Indraprastha and later of Hastinapura (Kuru). He was the leader of the successful Pandava side in the Kurukshetra War.

Despite being the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthira had relatively poor fighting skills, possessed by peaceful qualities; passive-hearted and soft-spoken. 

Still, he was said to be very good at spear-fighting and at chariot racing. Yudhishthira was a polyglot, knowing unusual languages. He was known for his honesty, justice, sagacity, tolerance, good behaviour, and discernment. He understood politics and imbibed all the duties of king from Bhishma. During his twelve-year exile, Yudhishthira learnt to magically control dice from the sage Brihadashwa.

Doesn't make any sense?
